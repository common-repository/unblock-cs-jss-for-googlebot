Modifies robots.txt to allow Googlebot access JS and CSS files.

== Description ==

Unblock CSS & JS for Googlebot plugin allows Googlebot to access the JavaScript and CSS files.

Google periodically sends to webmasters warnings that their JavaScript .js files and their CSS stylesheets are blocked - even when the webmasters have never explicitly done so. In fact, it is estimated that 85% of all users of Google webmaster tools have received such a warning.

Unblock CSS & JS for Googlebot solves this problem for you -- and no configuration is needed. Just install and activate the plugin.

How does it work? It just adds in three lines to your robots.txt file to ensure the Google spider can get through.

You don't want it anymore? Just uninstall and the added lines will be removed.
